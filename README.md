# Development Containers: LAMP

This is a project to build a lamp server in a remote container linked to VSCode. It is as simple as possible, so KISS. Based on the VSCode container examples https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers/tree/master/containers/php and the Mattrayner's project : https://github.com/mattrayner/docker-lamp

> **Note:** If you're following the quick start, you can jump to the [Things to try](#things-to-try) section.

## Setting up the development container

Follow these steps to open this sample in a container:

1. If this is your first time using a development container, please follow the [getting started steps](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started).

2. To use this repository, you can either open the repository in an isolated Docker volume:

   open a locally cloned copy of the code:

   - Clone this repository to your local filesystem.
   - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and select the **Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...** command.
   - Select the cloned copy of this folder, wait for the container to start
   - From the terminal, run `bash /scripts/onBoot.sh`
   - And try things out!

## Things to try

Once you have this sample opened in a container, you'll be able to work with it like you would locally.

> **Note:** This container runs as a non-root user with sudo access by default. Comment out `"remoteUser": "vscode"` in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` if you'd prefer to run as root.

Some things to try:

1. **Edit:**
   - Open `index.php`
   - Try adding some code and check out the language features.
2. **Terminal:** Press <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>\`</kbd> and type `uname` and other Linux commands from the terminal window.
3. **Run and Debug:**
   - Open `index.php`
   - Add a breakpoint (e.g. on line 4).
   - Press <kbd>F5</kbd> to launch the app in the container.
   - Once the breakpoint is hit, try hovering over variables, examining locals, and more.
4. **Running a server:**
   - From the terminal, run `bash /scripts/onBoot.sh`
   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost` and `http://localhost/phpMyAdmin`.
   - Look back at the terminal, and you should see the output from your site navigations
5. **Attach debugger to the server:**
   - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and select the **View: Show Debug** command
   - Pick "Listen for XDebug" from the dropdown
   - Press <kbd>F5</kbd> to attach the debugger
   - Add a breakpoint to `index.php` if you haven't already
   - Reload your browser window
   - Once the breakpoint is hit, try hovering over variables, examining locals, and more.
